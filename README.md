Welcome to one of my first projects! This is a simple version of tic-tac-toe that uses a two-dimensional array and runs the game in the console. 

My name is Joshua Tiffany and I am a Computer Science and Data Science student at Illinois State University. I am using this project to familiarize myself with GitHub for work in future projects. I also have a few goals to expand on this project to learn new skills.

Currently, the project works by initializing a 3-by-3 array and has players take turns entering the coordinates of the space they would like to place a marker in. After enough moves for a win to have occurred, the program will check for a win after each move. Once a win is found or there are no more possible moves, the game will end and declare either a winner or a tie.

Features of the project include:
Modifiable board size: Numbers are not hard-coded in any methods of the project and will adapt to a change in the SIZE variable.
Quick win detection: Once a win is detected, the program will not continue to check for other wins to improve efficiency.

Future plans for the project:
1. Use Java Swing to create a GUI for the project.
2. Use the minimax algorithm to create a bot that always plays the best move.
3. Implement alpha-beta pruning in the minimax algorithm to improve bot efficiency.
4. Add bots with different difficulty levels that the player can choose from.
